# Vue learning process

## 1.Day
Today I started to watch The Net Ninja - VUE JS Tutorial for beginners on YouTube.

I learned about what is Vue in general, how to create Vue App, stand-alone widgets and output dynamic variables in the HTML. 

Big take away of the day is Vue directives. Simply it is an instruction inside the HTML for Vue to do certain things in a certain way.

I know the following directives until now:
- v-on:event or @event
- v-if="", v-else-if="", v-else and v-show=""
Note v-show uses CSS display none or block to show or hide a certain thing if the condition is met. While v-if, v-else-if, v-else takes the HTML element out from the DOM.
- v-for="item/data/abc IN data", :key="item.id"-> reorder object item by id
- v-bind:attribute (v-bind:href or :href)
- v-bind:class="{key-value}" - if the value us true, the key is going to be a class "name"

## 2.Day
I started to dive in to full Vue project with different components and props. What I really like in a Vue component is that it has a well defined 3 parts (template, script and style). It makes the components more understandable. Right now my head is spinning from the lot of information. I need to process it.
