# Hi ðŸ‘‹

## This is my journey to learn up a JS framework myself
After finishing the JavaScript course in the bootcamp (ProOktatas), I am ready to jump into a JS framework. Initially I chose React and even started to check out some videos. But life is a mystery and I ended up to get a job as a junior developer. The company is using VueJS so my priority is learning that one first. 
## Plan
Follow some tutorials and documentation.

Every tutorial and course going to have its own folder, where I upload codes, notes, thoughts and blog entries. 

I already have some big project ideas. The story is that we are renovating our home in the last 2 years and does not seem to end (yet..). And what is the worst in renovation projects? No, not just the continues surprises behind the walls, or the crappy electricity system or the weird sewage pipe connection... But the bills... Buying materials in shop or online and not really able to track the money... So my final idea is to build an app, which is user friendly and can save time and trouble with bills. I am looking forward to it. 

Btw, what do you think, which one  is going to be ready first? Our house or the app? I honestly hope the house ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

So lets get started! See detailed day to day learning process in the TheJourney.md - https://github.com/ViktoriaBors/frameworks/tree/main/Vue
